### (daily) Todo
- [ ] ACC criteria
- [ ] Write test for new Product Type
- [ ] Write test for Github connection

### Done
- [x] Have a crazy side-project idea
- [x] Create my TODO.md because I do not need another Jira board in my life
- [x] Setup base module

### ACC criteria
- Has a new product type that can be used for a 'playground-product'
- Playground product is synced with their own respective repository on GitHub. A cron runs once a week to update the information
- The product edit view has been modified
- Product is based on a Virtual Type, free and can be ordered
- A playground product visually shows changes via AI. E.g. The commit for this module is: Unit test for PlayGround Product Type
- A change should include: 
  - a commit message (title)
  - Image (AI generated)
  - description (Comment on commit). Comment should be synced two ways.
- Console command can be run to sync data
