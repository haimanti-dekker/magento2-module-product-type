<h1>Intro</h1>
Hi, my name is Haimanti Dekker. I work as a freelance backend developer and currently focus on Magento. 
I really would like to show my parents and friends what I am doing without boring them to death. 
That is why I've had a crazy idea: create a playground that automatically tracks code, visualizes it combined with Magento.

### Todo
- [ ] ACC criteria
- [ ] Write test for new Product Type
- [ ] Write test for Github connection
- [ ] 

### Done
- [x] Have a crazy side-project idea
- [x] Create my TODO.md because I do not need another Jira board in my life
- [x] Setup base module

### ACC criteria
- <strong>Has a new product type that can be used for a 'playground-product'</strong>
- Playground product is synced with their own respective repository on GitHub. A cron runs once a week to update the information
- The product edit view has been modified
- Product is based on a Virtual Type, free and can be ordered
- A playground product visually shows changes via AI. E.g. The commit for this module is: Unit test for PlayGround Product Type
- A change should include: 
  - a commit message (title)
  - Image (AI generated)
  - description (Comment on commit). Comment should be synced two ways.
