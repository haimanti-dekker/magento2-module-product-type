<h1>Intro</h1>
Hi, my name is Haimanti Dekker. I work as a freelance backend developer and currently focus on Magento. 
I really would like to show my parents and friends what I am doing without boring them to death. 
That is why I've had a crazy idea: create a playground that automatically tracks code, visualizes it combined with Magento.
